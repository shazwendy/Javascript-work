DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UNDEFINED AND NULL IN CONNECTION TO ES.
-Null is an object with a valid value, has no properties and is non-mutable while undefined is assigned a variable type to an object in the following cases:
oAn object has been declared but not defined.
oAn object property that has not existed.
oA function that has not been supplied.
oReturn value of functions that have to but don’t return a value.

-Null use a “typeof” operator and gives output as “object” whereas the “typeof” used in undefined gives the object as “undefined”.

-An arithmetic conversion done on “null” gives the value determined as 0 while undefined doesn’t carry out an arithmetic conversion: if “undefined is added to a numeral, one gets NaN (Not a Number).

EXPLANATION OF DECLARATION, INITIALIZATION AND DEFINITION IN JS.
DECLARATION.
•It means creating a variable in JS.
•One declares a JS variable with the var keyword.
•After the declaration of a variable, the variable does not have a value since it has the value of undefined.
•One can also declare a function where the function will be a function object.
•The function declared will have all the properties, methods and behaviors of the function objects where they also return undefined.
•Important thing to note is that a variable should not be declared twice.
•An example:
Var = “book”

DEFINITION.
•Is mostly used in functions.
•A function can be defined based on a condition.
•A function definition consists of the function keyword followed by :
	o Name of the function.
	o A list of parameters to the function enclosed in brackets and separated by commas.
	o JS statements that define the functions are enclosed in the curly brackets. {}
•An example:
var x = 0;
if (x === 0) {
x = 10;
function boo() {}
•It gives a result
f boo()
INITIALIZATION.
•It is the assigning of an initial value to a variable.
•A variable is initialized by the use of the var keyword.
•Object initializer is an expression that describes the initialization of an object.
•Variable declaration can be done at the time of variable creation or a later point when the variable is needed. 
•An example:
var q = 6;
q += 10;
q = 16
